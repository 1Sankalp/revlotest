Some background infoRoam is a note-taking tool for the "networked brain." What does that mean?It emulates how your brain works, which is in a mashed web of interconnected thoughts rather than a linear and folder structure. How did it come to be?Before founding Roam, Conor founded two prior businesses and also worked at HuffPost as a Co-Founder of HuffPost Labs, where he reported directly to Arianna Huffington and HuffPost CTO.Ok, let's dive into the first 1000The Tesla Go to market strategy 🚙Tesla's started with the sports car, the high-end complex cumbersome version of what they were trying to do. They went after the people who loved cars and would appreciate the subtle and nuanced improvements they can bring to the industry, even if, at first, they came at the cost of complexity, price, and other variables. These were the loudest and most cynical people to please, but at the same time the most advocate and passionate users of cars in general.The Roam Adoption of Tesla Go to Market 🚙 Similarly, when Roam Research started, their quest was to find those same kinds of users. Users with a problem that is so complex that they were willing to learn and adopt new tools and workflows.These were not your "CEOs" or "Twitter influencers." These were..AI safety communityPeople thinking about AI risk, who had to do a lot of research, understand and dissect a complicated topic.Rationalist Bay Area thinkersPeople who think about thinking. They were working on understanding how to process emotions and deal with thinking biases.In fact, despite being a "hyped" consumer product, their first 1000 or so users came exclusively from enterprise license deals with a handful of these organizations. As long as they kept building features, those researchers and philosophers would continue using the product and Roam were able to charge and renew their enterprise license deals.The misconception of "waiting lists."A few years of developing the "sports car" features of Roam -in congestion with working very closely with power users to find product-market fit- came the "request access" feature that many wrongly attribute as the key driver to their “popularity.”Nevertheless it is still an important aspect on how to scale demand once you MOVE BEYOND YOUR FIRST 1000 users. Let’s dive a bit into the phenomena of #RoamCult which is their current growth catalyst.🧟‍♂️#RoamCult...the product side From a product perspective, Conor describes his Roam as a "Low Floor High Ceiling" product. Which means they created a product with a very low entry point and a very steep learning curve. The learning curve is a crucial component behind much of the momentum of the product. Roam is very easy to get started and very powerful if you learn it(..similar to how excel) is, and the steep learning curve is good! Even though it is a lot of effort, that means users can learn it quickly and become that much more powerful and unlock the "superpowers" of your product. That is a primary ingredient of making people vocal about your product.🧟‍♂️#RoamCult..the Twitter sideConor used twitter like he did roam, creating threads and threads of threads of the philosophy behind the product. Roam and other popular products with cult following had in common a strong belief about how things "ought to be" rather than how they are. And this is how Conor leveraged twitter to create a strong following behind Roam. It has seldom been the case that a founder uses his "social capital" to build hype behind a product but instead using his "product" to build hype around himself and consequently, his product. Here are a few actionable examples on how he did thatTweeting abt why Evernote is a terrible second brain Tweeting about the frustration of using tools that force people to think in a "linear model."Getting into fights with people who like Evernote and explain why they are fundamentally wrong.Explaining the science, math, and psychology about how a human brain works.It doesn't hurt be loud and opinionated abt what your beliefs. It will resonate with some, frustrate others, but that is the case with any fundamentally different product.. it challenges the current mode of thinking.🧟‍♂️#RoamCult..the mission sideA cult has a shared belief and mission that resonates very strongly with a concentrated group of people. For Roam, that mission was and still is "building a second brain." Building on from thereWhat we see now from the rising popularity of Roam Research is the result of building a product with the most cynical power users for a couple of years and having a crystal clear view on how note-taking ought to be and being loud about it. But more specifically, here is how they got from enterprise deals to the hottest consumer product in 2020.Going after people who are willing to learn how to use power tools. Instead of the lowest common denominator. People who may individually exhibit the same characteristics as researches. Those are your "intellectual athletes." Intellectual athletes are your writers, researchers, and people who "hacked" twitter as a medium to express their thoughts and views of different topics and beliefs. Intellectual athletes often have a following of people that aspire to think and act like them. They are the so called “thought leaders”Intellectual athletes are prone to being power users, and Roam's efficacy in the connecting different thoughts  makes them likely to personally drive next-wave customers.In essence, instead of appealing to the public or the "most influential," Roam went after the people "most likely to be a power user." and those people did all the heavy lifting.

SubscribeA Little bit about the companySlice was started by Ilir Sela, a self-proclaimed "third-generation pizza." in 2010 and was initially named Mypizza, in tribute to the first pizzeria that Illia owned and managed. Unlike Doordash, Postmates, and other food aggregators, Slice takes a vertically integrated approach to delivery, which they dubbed as a "reverse franchise" model.What is a reverse franchise model exactly?Think of it as bringing the same kind of value to local pizzerias as Domino's delivers to their franchisees.Aggregating buying power for SMBs for things like Pizza boxes decreasing costs by as much as 80%Being the "back-office" for local pizzerias eliminating the need for hiring part-time workers for managing orders, answering calls..etcIncrease basket-size and order frequency for local pizzerias by a marketplace digital offering minus all crazy fees aggregators charge.Negotiating and offering 3rd party services(such as delivery) at competitive prices due to the aggregated buying power.Time for the good stuff...How did they get their first 1000 customers?Loyalty first, discovery second.To get started and even to this day, Ilir focused his sales pitch on getting more orders from YOUR CUSTOMERS rather than onboarding new clients as the other food aggregators preach. Ilir explains that if you've been living in a neighborhood for enough time, you likely already know what your favorite pizza spot is. The issue then becomes one of delivery as opposed to restaurant selection. That made it more compelling to onboard new clients and leap-frog the chicken and egg marketplace—liquidity problem.Okay... but still, how did he get pizzerias on board?He picked up the phone and started calling in local pizzerias and insisted on showing up personally at the store.  That humanized the company and allowed him to develop some rapport with small business owners. To lend himself more credibility heLeased a small car and wrapped it with the brandParked it in front of the small restaurant to make sure they see itWeirdly, that small gesture gave him even more credibility and made it seem that they had scale when they didn't.Was that it?Not quite it. When meeting with owners of these shops about his "digital" solution, it felt like a massive change to the business operations and made a lot of small shop owners reluctant to get on board.At the same time, he noticed that all these menus still had fax numbers that were used by companies nearby to order in lunch for their employees. So instead of trying to sell his solution, he decided to sell his value proposition which is MORE ORDERS FROM YOUR CUSTOMER and so heChanged pitch to "Do you want more fax orders" rather than do you want to join our platform. Easy, simple way to demonstrate value.Figured out how to turn online orders into faxes and offered almost no downside for people joiningAfter onboarding new "fax clients" and demonstrating value, he would then go on to onboard them onto the Slice platform, which offered even more value and increased efficiency to the owners.His parting words of advice"Fit yourself within the existing workflow to show value and then change them for the better. "That is it for today, See you on Sunday 😉

SubscribeLet's start from the beginning. Founder Katrina Lake started Stitch Fix in 2010 during her second year MBA at Harvard Business School. Unlike other founder stories we hear, she doesn't claim that she was "born to be an entrepreneur." Going to business school was her way of de-risking the process and gave her two study years to explore building a company. Her goals before graduation were to  Test different "Hypothesis." Start a companyRaise money and be able to afford to pay back her loansAnd sure enough just two months shy of graduating, she had raised her Seed round from Baseline Ventures to what was then named Rack Habit.You don't need an MVP to get started.After dabbling around with a few hypotheses- one of which was exploring the Fishing and Hunting industry- she landed on apparel shopping. Her thesis at the time was that as the death spiral for retailors has started, and more of the retail shopping experience has shifted online, the nuanced and emotional aspect of apparel shopping has been stripped away. Then it became a matter of how she can deliver an online personal shopping experience in apparel.Because Katrina took a very scientific approach to company building, experimenting with and validating different hypotheses, she didn't even create a landing page for her new idea. All she needed was a google form.Validating the ideaAs a young student living and studying in Boston, with few friends living in the area, she was continually meeting strangers and friends of friends to build up her social circle. So she leaned into that as well when trying to build her "company" and would send out surveys to friends of friends asking them about their shopping habits and telling them about Stitch Fix.But how did she buy the clothes, packaging and other stuff she needed?She used her credit card, which had a limit of $6,000.She was able to source and procure clothes from boutique stores with a 14-30 day return window. Whatever didn't sell, she would then return it for a refund. While she did not make any money from validating the idea, she has also managed to do so without spending or losing any money.After running this test with around 20 friends of friends, she was able to validate that:A survey was etiquette enough to be able to style a stranger. There was no need to be physically around them, as has been the case with personal stylists.People were open to and found value in purchasing from new brands they had not heard of before100+ Orders in, still no websiteAfter validating the concept in February 2010 in Boston while still a student at HBS, Katrina managed to raise a $500k Seed Round two months later from Baseline Ventures. Between creating "fixes" and shipping them, closing the round, and graduating school, Katrina found no need to build a website just yet. If you wanted a Fix, you had to email her and fill out the survey she sent.The first couple of months after raising money go like this:-April: Raises Seed and ships 29 orders -May: Graduates HBS and ships 35-June: Hires an intern, relocates to San Francisco, launches a blog, and ships 110 orders.-July: Ships 235 ordersFinally a landing pageSeven months into the company and after hitting a few thousand orders, Katrina finally launched a landing page in November 2011. A landing page where you can fill out the survey and join the waitlist until Stitch Fix was ready to serve you. Sometimes it took two weeks, and other times, it took three months to get your first Fix.The company relied religiously on two aspects to get their first few hundred thousand orders.They were mobilizing 50k-100k following Instagrammers who loved the product and encouraged them to post about their Stitch Fix experience.Word of mouth from customers through Instagram and Pinterest postsSixteen months after starting the company, Stitch Fix hit 100,000 orders. They leaned onto those two organic acquisition channels and kept deferring their marketing budget from one year to the next as they could not keep up with the demand for a few more years.That's it for today. See you on Thursday. 😉Subscribe
